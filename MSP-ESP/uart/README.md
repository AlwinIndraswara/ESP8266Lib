A simple piece of code that transmits and receives data over the MSP430 UART.
Based on the example at http://homepages.ius.edu/RWISMAN/C335/HTML/msp430SerialComm.htm
which is based on TI LaunchPad examples.

The last character is not sent so a dummy space is always padded [in main()]. This needs to be investigated and fixed.
