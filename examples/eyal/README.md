wifi-3.lua
  An example of code that I use to test my app. It publishes an item periodically (no dsleep).
  It can either just publish a count or actually read the temperature off a ds18b20. This last usage always
  fails me with "not enough memory" when loading the required module if using firmware 20150227.
  When using fw 20150216 it fails to connect to the mqtt broker.

To be continued...
